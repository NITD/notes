			<h1>General Management</h1>

			<p>
				Management has been around for as long as there has been a need for decision making. Management theories have been adopted from other disciplines and applied to real life situations with a focus on performance on managerial roles. It has continuously adopted new theories and practices and replaced old ones so as to make management activity increasingly efficient.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the early 20<sup>th</sup> century the focus was on physical factors viewed from industrial, engineering and economic perspective. Subsequently the focus shifted to productivity with an emphasis on human factors.
			</p>

			<p>
				The schools of management thought are theoretical frameworks of the study of management. Each of the schools of management thought are based on somewhat different assumptions about human beings and the organisations for which they work.
			</p>

			<h2>1. The Classical Perspective</h2>

			<p>
				This is the oldest formal viewpoint of management which includes scientific management approach, administrative management approach and bureaucratic management approach.
			</p>

			<h3>1.1. Scientific Management Approach</h3>

			<p>
				Scientific approach or perspective of management focusses on the productivity of the individual worker. Frederick Taylor stated that there is one best way to perform each task and used scientific methods to study how workers performed their jobs. His observations lead him to formulate opinions in the areas of task performance, supervision, and motivation.
			</p>

			<h3>1.2. Administrative Management Approach</h3>

			<p>
				Administrative management focusses on managers and the functions they perform. It is most closely identified with Henri Fayol. He was the first to recognise that successful managers had to understand the basic managerial functions which he identified as planning, organising, commanding, coordinating and controlling.
			</p>

			<h3>1.3. Bureaucratic Management Approach</h3>

			<p>
				The perspective of management that focusses on the overall organisational system and is based on firm rules, policies and procedures, a fixed hierarchy, and a clear division of labour. Max Weber, a German sociologist and historian, is most closely associated with bureaucratic management. He envisioned a system of management that would be based upon impersonal and rational behaviour.
			</p>

			<h2>2. Behaviour Perspective</h2>

			<p>
				It followed the classical perspective and acknowledged the importance of human behaviour in shaping management style. Mary Parker observed managers performing their jobs and concluded that they key to effective management is coordination. In addition, she also promoted team work and employee empowerment and felt that it was inappropriate for a manager to insist the workers perform a task in only one specifically prescribed way.
			</p>

			<p>
				Douglas McGregor proposed the theory X and theory Y. Theory X managers perceived that their subordinates have an inherent dislike for work and will avoid it if at all possible. Theory Y managers perceived that their subordinates enjoy work and gain satisfaction from performing their jobs.
			</p>

			<h2>3. Quantitative Perspective</h2>

			<p>
				It has its roots in the scientific management approach, and is characterised by its use of mathematics, statistics and other quantitative techniques for management, decision making and problem solving.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are four characteristics of the quantitative perspective:
			</p>

			<h3>3.1. Decision Making Focus</h3>

			<p>
				The primary focus of the quantitative approach is on problems or situations which require some direct action or decision on the part of the management.
			</p>

			<h3>3.2. Measurable Criteria</h3>

			<p>
				The decision making process requires that the decision makers select some alternative course of action. To make rational selection, alternatives must be compared on the basis of some measurable criteria / objectives such as profit, cost, return, investment, output rate.
			</p>

			<h3>3.3. Quantitative Model</h3>

			<p>
				To assess the impact of each alternative on the stated criteria, a quantitative model of the decision situation must be formulated. Quantitative models make use of mathematical symbols, equations and formulas to represent properties and relationships of the decision situation.
			</p>

			<h3>3.4. Computers</h3>

			<p>
				Although many quantitative models can be solved manually, the process is often time consuming, complex and costly. Subsequently, computers are quite useful in the problem solving process.
			</p>

			<h2>4. System Perspective</h2>

			<p>
				This is an approach to problem solving that attacks complex systems by breaking them into their constituent elements.
			</p>

			<p>
				The components of the system perspective are:
			</p>

			<h3>4.1. Inputs</h3>

			<p>
				Such diverse items as materials, workers, capital, land, equipment, customers and information used in creating products and services.
			</p>

			<h3>4.2. Outputs</h3>

			<p>
				Physical commodities or intangible services or information that is desired by by the customers / users of the system.
			</p>

			<h3>4.3. Transformation Process</h3>

			<p>
				The mechanism by which inputs are converted to outputs.
			</p>

			<h3>Open and Closed Systems</h3>

			<p>
				Open systems are processes that interact with the external environmnent to service. Closed systems do not interact with the external environment.
			</p>

			<h2>5. Contingency Perspective</h2>

			<p>
				A view that proposes that there is no 'one best way' approach to management for all situations. Further, it accepts that managers are responsible for determining which management approach is likely to be most effective in a given situation. This requires managers to identify key contingencies of a given situation.

			<h1>Leadership</h1>

			<p>
				Leadership is an important element in managing a system. A manager cannot manage efficiently unless he can lead his subordinates effectively. Leadership is the art of influencing others, to direct their will, abilities and efforts to the achievement of the leader's goals. In the context of an organisation, leadership lies in influencing individual and group efforts towards the optimal achievement of organisational goals and objectives. It focusses on people's aspect of management and is based on the assumption that organisational effectiveness significantly depends upon their motivation, effort and abilities.
			</p>

			<h2>Principle Tasks of Leadership</h2>

			<p>
				A manager is mainly concerned with setting objectives and goals, developing plans, strategies and policies, making jobs assignments, coordinating and controlling. The main task of the leader is to integrate the individuals and informal groups with the organisation so as to optimise their efforts for the achievement of the enterprise's goals. This depends on his ability to:
			</p>

			<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
				<li>
					Comprehend that people are different in their motivational patterns and motivation pattern of an individual is also subject to change from time to time.
				</li>
				<li>
					Gain an understanding of group dynamics.
				</li>
				<li>
					Create an environment which produces integration of individual and group goals with organisational goals.
				</li>
				<li>
					Inspire employees as individuals and group members to make their optimum contribution to organisational efficiency and effectiveness.
				</li>
				<li>
					Make sense of changing environment, interpret it to employees and redirect their efforts to adapt to changing situations.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				Organisations operate in a dynamic environment. Technology, markets, social values, legislation and many other forces interacting with the enterprise compel change within them. A leader anticipates, identifies and interprets change to his groups and facilitates its accommodation.
			</p>

			<h2>Approaches to Leadership</h2>

			<h3>1. Trait Approach</h3>

			<p>
				Early attempts at analysing leadership were aimed at identifying a finite number of intellectual, physical, social, emotional and other personality characteristics that would distinguish more effective from less effective leaders. This approach was based on the great man hypothesis holding that leaders are born not made.
			</p>

			<p>
				Stogdill concluded from a survey of traitist literature that the following distinguishing qualities are found in successful leaders:
			</p>

			<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
				<li>
					Physical traits such as height, health, appearance etc.
				</li>
				<li>
					Intelligence and ability traits such as ability to comprehend, conceptualise, plan etc.
				</li>
				<li>
					Personality traits such as tolerance of ambiguity.
				</li>
				<li>
					Task related traits such as achievement, drive, initiative, persistence etc.
				</li>
				<li>
					Social traits such as cooperativeness, administrative ability, interpersonal skills etc.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>2. Approach Based on the Use of Authority</h3>

			<p>
				The search for leadership traits was given up in favour of gaining and understanding how leaders used their authority in social situations.
			</p>

			<h4>2.1. Autocratic Authoritarian Leaders</h4>

			<p>
				These kinds of leaders give definite instructions, demand compliance, emphasise task performance, exercise close supervision, permit very little or no subordinate influence on decisions, and do not welcome suggestions from them.
			</p>

			<h4>2.2. Democratic Participative Leaders</h4>

			<p>
				These involve their subordinates individually as well as in groups in making decisions relating to their goals, permit them scope to take initiative and exercise judgement, emphasise group effort, exercise broad supervision, motivate subordinates for high level of performance, use influence rather than authority and build two way communication.
			</p>

			<h3>3. Likert's System 1-4 Approach</h3>

			<p>
				Rensis Likert regards leadership as the central and most important component of management. In his view organisational effectiveness significantly depends on the manner in which managers provide leadership to their subordinates. He classified leadership in four categories:
			</p>

			<h4>3.1. System 1 - Exploitative</h4>

			<p>
				Exploitative authoritative leaders are highly production oriented, display no confidence in their subordinates, provide them no influence in decision making, seldom seek or use subordinates' ideas, use fear, threats, punishment and occasional rewards to enforce compliance. They engage mainly in downward communication.
			</p>

			<h4>3.2 System 2 - Benevolent Authoritative</h4>

			<p>
				System 2 leadership style is called benevolent authoritative. These leaders have confidence and trust in their subordinates, allow some delegation in decision making, exercise close supervision, permit some upward communication, and create an environment in which subordinates do not feel quite free to talk to the superiors about their problems.
			</p>

			<h4>3.3 System 3 - Consultative</h4>

			<p>
				System 3 leaders are called consultative type. They display substantial confidence in their subordinates, consult them before making decisions, but make the decisions themselves, usually seek their ideas, motivate them by giving rewards, and engage in both upward and downward communication.
			</p>

			<h4>3.4 System 4 - Participating Group Leaders</h4>

			<p>
				System 4 leaders are called participating group leaders. They emphasise group decision making, group goals, and group performance, have full confidence in their subordinates, create an environment of mutual support, trust and confidence, give economic rewards on the basis of group involvement, engage in effective upward, downward and sideways communication.
			</p>

			<h3>4. Power Grid Approach to Management</h3>

			<p>
				The managerial grid approach was developed by Blake and Mouton. It focusses on various leadership behaviour of leadership styles.
			</p>

			<p>
				The grid shown above has been used as a means of identifying various combinations of leadership styles as well as a device of managerial training. The two dimensions of the grid show concern for productivity and concern for people indicating the extent of concert for production and people.
			</p>

			<p>
				1, 1 (Impoverished) style leader shows little concern for production and people.
			</p>

			<p>
				9,1 show production oriented behaviour.
			</p>

			<p>
				1, 9 (Country Club)
			</p>
			<p>
				5, 5 style leaders adopt mid of the road approach. They emphasise concern for both production and employees. They obtain adequate but not optimum performance and they involve people in decision making.
			</p>
			<p>
				9, 9 (Team Management)
			</p>

			<h3>5. Path Goal Approach to Leadership</h3>

			<p>
				The path goal approach to leadership was developed by House and Mitchell. It emphasises that leaders can optimise organisational effectiveness by influencing the path goal perceptions of their subordinates and their needs and satisfaction.
			</p>

			<p>
				Its first proposition is that subordinates accept a leader and respond to his goals, plans and policies to the extent that they perceive him as satisfying their immediate or future needs.
			</p>

			<p>
				Its second proposition is that a leader will be successful in obtaining employee task performance and contribution to the organisational goals.
			</p>

			<p>
				The path goal leadership approach derives its inferences from the expectance theory and stipulates that the strategic leadership functions lie in recognising subordinates' needs for outcomes over which the leader has some control.

			<h1>Communication</h1>

			<p>
				One of the most important contributory factors to the supremacy of the human species over others is our ability to communicate at a higher level. It helps us to meaningfully relate ourselves with others, exchange our ideas, share our thoughts, impact and gain knowledge, and build further communication on the basis of accomplishments of our past generations. It also enables us to organise our resources, abilities and efforts in common endeavour.
			</p>

			<p>
				The American Society of Training Directors regards communication as the interchange of thoughts or information to bring about mutual understanding and confidence for good human relations.
			</p>

			<p>
				Effective communication implies that the receiver should not only understand the message sent by the communicator but also accept and comply with it. Thus when a manager gives an instruction or and order to a subordinate which the latter does not understand in the same sense it is means by the former, communication has not taken place. Also, if the subordinate understands the communication but does not accept it or does not comply with it, the communication has failed in its purpose.
			</p>

			<h2>Importance of Communication</h2>

			<p>
				Communication is one of the central aspects of all managerial activeties. It has been estimated that a manager spends 90% of his time communicating, reading, writing, listening, guiding, instructing, approving and so forth.
			</p>

			<p>
				Effectiveness of a manager depends significantly on his ability to communicate effectively with superiors, subordinates, external agencies such as customers, bankers, suppliers, unions, the government and so forth. His ability to make sound decisions, plans, policies, procedures, standards, methods, instructions, rules and orders should be appropriately and adequately communicated to subordinates in order to enable them to perform accordingly.
			</p>

			<p>
				In organising resources, jobs, activites and tasks, and particularly in assigning responsibilities, delegating authority and extracting obligations from subordinates to perform effectively, a manager's success significantly depends on his communication abilities.
			</p>

			<h2>Process of Communication</h2>

			<p>
				Communication involves at least two persons, the sender and the receiver.
			</p>

			<p>
				[ Sender - Ideas, Information, Feelings, Attitudes, Values, etc. ]
			</p>

			<p>
				[ Encoding ]
			</p>

			<p>
				[ Message ]
			</p>

			<p>
				[ Medium ]
			</p>

			<p>
				[ Receiver ] <- [ Perceptions, Needs, Expectations ]
			</p>

			<p>
				[ Decoding ]
			</p>

			<p>
				[ Message Received ]
			</p>

			<p>
				[ Sender ]

			<h1>Marketing Management</h1>

			<p>
				Market is a place where exchange of goods and services takes place in exchange of money. Marketers use numerous tools to elicit the desired response from their target markets. These tools constitute the marketing mix. It is a set of marketing tools that the firm uses to pursue its marketing objectives and promote its brand and product in the market. It is used to influence trade channels as well as end consumers.
			</p>

			<p>
				The firm can change its price, inventory and advertising expenditure in the short run. However, it can develop new products and modify its distribution channels only in the long run. Thus, the firm makes fewer marketing mix changes in the short run than in the long run.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are various approaches which are used and evolved over time with the use of technology. It is often associated with the 4 Ps of marketing which are:
			</p>

			<h3>1. Product</h3>

			<p>
				It refers to the item actually being sold which can either be tangible or intangible. It must deliver the minimum level of performance otherwise other elements of marketing mix may fail in their objective.
			</p>

			<h3>2. Price</h3>

			<p>
				Once a concrete understanding of product efficiency is established, then it starts with price decision. It depends on cost of production, segment targeted, ability of market to pay, supply, demand, and a host of other direct and indirect factors.
			</p>

			<h3>3. Place</h3>

			<p>
				It refers to the point of sale. In every industry, catching hold of the consumer and making it easy for the consumer to buy is the main aim of a good distribution, or place strategy.
			</p>

			<h3>4. Promotion</h3>

			<p>
				This refers to all activities undertaken to make the product or service known to the user and trader. This can include advertising, press reports, incentives, awards to the trader, consumer schemes, direct marketing, contests, prizes, etc.
